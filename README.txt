Code for the study of the dynamics of the H2 molecule.

SC_Hartree_Fock: self-consistent Hartree-Fock at different internuclear distances X

SC_DFT: self-consistent DFT at different internuclear distances X. The XC functionals can be chosen from the libxc library. Only LDA is supported in the code

BOMD_HF: Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics with Hartree-Fock used in the search of the ground state

CPMD_HF: Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics in the Hartree-Fock approximation (no XC functional). Multiple trajectories with random initial positions and velocities can be produced

CPMD_DFT: Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics with the XC part

CG_shake: molecular dynamics driven by the conjugate gradient minimisation of the energy functional
